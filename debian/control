Description: cryptographic library for EAC version 2 (tools)
 OpenPACE implements Extended Access Control (EAC) version 2 as specified
 in BSI TR-03110. OpenPACE comprises support for the following protocols:
 .
  * Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE)
  * Terminal Authentication (TA)
  * Chip Authentication (CA)
 .
 OpenPACE also supports Card Verifiable Certificates (CV Certificates)
 and signing requests as well as easy to use wrappers for using the
 established secure channels.
 .
 OpenPACE supports all variants of PACE (DH/ECDH, GM/IM), TA
 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5/RSASSA-PSS/ECDSA), CA (DH/ECDH) and all
 standardised domain parameters (GFP/ECP).
